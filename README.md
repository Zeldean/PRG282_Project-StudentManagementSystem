This project is a C# Windows Forms application that serves as a Student Management System. The system provides functionality for managing student records, and supporting collaboration through Git and GitHub for version control and source tracking. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and generate summary reports.

## Features

- **Add New Student**: The application provides a form interface to input student details such as Student ID, Name, Surname, Age, Phone Number, and Course. These details are saved to a text file named `students.txt`.

- **View All Students**: The records from `students.txt` are displayed in a DataGridView control, offering a quick view of all students.

- **Update Student Information**: Users can select students by clicking on their entry in the DataGridView and edit their details, which are saved back to `students.txt`.

- **Delete a Student**: Users can delete a student by selecting them from the DataGridView, removing the corresponding entry from the text file.

- **Generate Summary Report**: The application calculates the total number of students and the average age, displaying these results on the form and saving them to `summary.txt`.

- **Log Changes**: Each action performed on student records (Add, Update, Delete) is logged with details and timestamps, ensuring traceability.

- **Error Handling and Validations**: Proper error messages are displayed in case of issues such as invalid input or file access problems. Validation is performed for required fields like Student ID, Name, and Age to ensure data integrity.

- **Version Control Integration**: The development process is tracked using Git, with regular commits after each feature implementation. The project has also been pushed to a GitHub repository for remote backup and collaboration.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET (Windows Forms)
- **Database**: SQLite is used to store logs of actions performed on the student records.
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
